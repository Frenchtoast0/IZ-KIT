# IZ-KIT

Created for NAIT's Computer Engineering Technology capstone.

Multiple hardware nodes with modular functionality connect to a
server and are routed using a custom programming language (IZ Language)
to perform virtual "circuits".  
ex. Pushing a pushbutton on a node can be programmed to turn on an LED on another node.
